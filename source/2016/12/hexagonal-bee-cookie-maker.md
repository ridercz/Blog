<!-- dcterms:abstract = After I did my Cookie stamper project, a friend asked me if I could make a cookie cutter of hexagonal shape with a bee stamp. Of couse I can! So, here I proudly present you the hexagonal cutter, superb for work efficiency! The entire system isn't modular, as I don't expect multiple motifs for hexagonal cookies. -->
