<!-- dcterms:abstract = My small son loves electronics, especially if they have blinking lights and bunch of buttons. So I designed this light ramp, which is controller by Arduino and can display different light effects. Print: ledcubetoy_holder_top.stl and ledcubetoy_holder_bottom.stl in any color. It's a quite big part, I had to position it diagonally on my Prusa i3 MK2. ledcubetoy_cube.stl or ledcubetoy_cylinder.stl in transparent. Any combination of these, has to be 8 total. -->
